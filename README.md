# StegHub - DevOps/Cloud Engineering

## Emmanuel Okose's Journey Through the DevOps and Cloud Engineering Horizon.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my experiences and explorations in the kingdom of Cloud and DevOps Engineering. As I navigate this journey, I try my best to stay committed to adhering to best practices, this means I will be following the established code of conduct, and meticulously document the various projects I undertake along the way. Please, if you find any of my practice that is not adhering to the established code of conduct, kindly give me a feedback via [my email](gmail.com): kosenuel@gmail.com

### Little intro

Kindly keep in mind that as you navigate through this repo, you can anticipate to encounter valuable information relevant to beginners, intermediates, and experts in the field. Guided by "who-know-road" (i.e., StegHub `:)` ), I am sure to navigate the diverse terrains—both simple and complex—of the DevOps and Cloud Engineering domain with confidence and precision.

### Contents of This Repository (and a bit of description)

- **Project 1: [Deploy a Complete LAMP Stack on AWS](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/1.LAMP_Stack)** - In this project, I successfully deployed a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web stack on an EC2 instance in AWS.


- **Project 2:** [**Deploy a Complete LEMP Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/2.LEMP_Stack) - In this project, I deployed a web app (utilizing the LEMP stack) on an EC2 instance of AWS.

- **Project 3:** [**Deployed a MERN Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/3.MERN_Stack):This project helped me understand in great depth how modern web apps functions and I am happy to have executed this project. The web app deployed here was a "to-do" web app that helps users track their to do lists.

- **Project 4:** [**Deploy a MEAN Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/4.MEAN_Stack): Here, I deployed a web app called "Book Management", it helps users add, delete, view and track records of books (for an online store or library supposedly). I achieved this using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express js, Angular js, and Node js).

- **Project 5:** [**Client Server Architecture with mysql**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/5.Client-Server_Architecture): This project illustrates the dynamic communication between clients and servers within a network (specifically over the internet). Here, we set up a MySQL Client-Server architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
