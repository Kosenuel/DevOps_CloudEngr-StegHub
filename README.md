# StegHub - DevOps/Cloud Engineering

## Emmanuel Okose's Journey Through DevOps and Cloud Engineering.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my experiences and explorations in the kingdom of Cloud and DevOps Engineering. As I navigate this journey, I try my best to stay committed to adhering to best practices, this means I will be following the established code of conduct known in the I.T field, and meticulously document the various projects I undertake along the way. Please, if you find any of my practice that is not adhering to the established code of conduct, kindly give me a feedback via [my email](kosenuel@gmail.com): kosenuel@gmail.com

### Little intro

Kindly keep in mind that as you navigate through this repo, you should anticipate to encounter valuable information relevant to beginners, intermediates, and experts in the field. I was guided by "who-know-road" (i.e., StegHub `:)` ), and I am sure to navigate the diverse terrains—both simple and complex—of the DevOps and Cloud Engineering domain with confidence and precision.

### Contents of This Repository (and a bit of description)

- **Project 1: [Deploy a Complete LAMP Stack on AWS](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/1.LAMP_Stack)** - In this project, I successfully deployed a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web stack on an EC2 instance in AWS.


- **Project 2:** [**Deploy a Complete LEMP Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/2.LEMP_Stack) - In this project, I deployed a web app (utilizing the LEMP stack) on an EC2 instance of AWS.

- **Project 3:** [**Deployed a MERN Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/3.MERN_Stack):This project helped me understand in great depth how modern web apps functions and I am happy to have executed this project. The web app deployed here was a "to-do" web app that helps users track their to do lists.

- **Project 4:** [**Deploy a MEAN Stack on AWS**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/4.MEAN_Stack): Here, I deployed a web app called "Book Management", it helps users add, delete, view and track records of books (for an online store or library supposedly). I achieved this using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express js, Angular js, and Node js).

- **Project 5:** [**Client Server Architecture with mysql**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/5.Client-Server_Architecture): This project illustrates the dynamic communication between clients and servers within a network (specifically over the internet). Here, we set up a MySQL Client-Server architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

- **Project 6:** [**Web Solution With  WordPress**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/6.Web_Solution_With_Word_Press): In this project, we explored how to deploy a wordpress solution for an organization and all the necessary steps you would need as a dev guy to get this done.

- **Project 7:** [**DevOps Tooling Website Solution**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/7.DevOps_Tooling_Website_Solution): In this project, we configured a web architecture where we had three web servers access a single nfs server and a single database, this made the webservers serve thesame content but on different machines.

- **Project 8:** [**Load Balancer Using Apache**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/8.Load_Balancer_With_Apache): In this project, we configured Apache to distribute loads evenly to the 3 webservers in the previous project. We created a single load balancing server that when contacted (via its public IP), it routes the request(s) of the clients to any of the 3 servers behind this following the `by traffic` method.

- **Project 9:** [**Tooling Website deployment**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/9.Tooling_Website_Deployment_and_Automation): We created a pipeline (using Jen) that looks at a git repository for changes _(push changes)_ and when it finds any change(s), it builds and deploys the artifact to the NFS Server we created in the last two projects.

- **Project 10:** [**Load Balancer With Nginx (TLS/SSL)**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/10.Load_Balancer_With_Nginx_%26_SSL-TLS): In this project, we created a load balancer, this time, using Nginx. We didn't just stopped there, we also went to add a domain name to our Load balancer whilst assigning an Elastic IP address to it.
Then in the side notes, I attempted to create a Prometheus + Grafana monitoring solution to tie these up. Click to find out more...

- **Project 11:** [**Ansible - configuration management**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/11.Ansible_-_Config-Mgmt): In this project, we created a playbook that automates the configuration of a web server or hundreds of web servers as the case may be. This project was a bit challenging for me, but I am glad I was able to pull through.

- **Project 12:** [**Ansible - Refactoring and Static Assignments**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/12.Ansible-Refactoring_and_Static_Assignments): In this project, we refactored the playbook we created in the last project for better readability, reusability and organization. We also created a new playbook that verifies the functionality of an Apache web server in this project.

- **Project 13:** [**Ansible - Dynamic Assignments and Community Roles**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/13.Ansible-Dynamic_Assignment_%26_Community_Roles#reference-documentation): In this project, we created a playbook that dynamically loads other playbook on runtime, furthermore, we implemented community roles - this addition helped to greatly simplify tasks additions (e.g: installing and configuring mysql databases, configuring the server os and so on.)

- **Project 14:** [**Experiencing Continuous Integration and Continus Deployment/Delivery Using Jenkins, Ansible, Artifactory, Github, Php**](https://github.com/Kosenuel/DevOps_CloudEngr-StegHub/tree/main/14.Continuous_Integration_With_Jenkins_Ansible_SonarQube): In this project, we created a CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins and armed it with rich tools (Ansible, Artifactory, SonarQube, Git, etc...) to enable us perform different actions on code once it has been pushed to a github repository, when the code passes all these tests and checks, it is then delivered/deployed to the target webserver. This was an interesting project.
