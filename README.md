# StegHub - DevOps/Cloud Engineering

## Emmanuel Okose's Exodus exploring the tapestry of DevOps && Cloud Engineering terrain

__This repository was created as a pool that helps me collate and journal my adventures, as I wander in the realms of Cloud and DevOps Engineering. Note that as I wander, I do not do so as I please or see fit, I ensure that I follow best practices, stick to the code of conduct and document the different conquered quest (projects) I accomplish on my way.__

__What you should expect to see here__

As you explore my journal, have it at the back of your mind to expect to see information that is relevant to both beginners, intermediate, and experts in the field. Because I followed "who-know-road" (i.e StegHub) to guide/show me through the different terrains (easy and complex) in the DevOps and Cloud Engineering Continent _(so that I nor go miss road)_
