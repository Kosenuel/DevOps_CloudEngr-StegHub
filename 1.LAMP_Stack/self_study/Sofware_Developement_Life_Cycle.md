# Software Development Life Cycle
### Introduction

__This self study document explains in some level of depth the nitty gritties of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The SDLC encompasses the various phases a software project passes through from conceptualization to deployment and further maintenance.__

## Stages involved in the SDLC

### 1. Planning

- Here the scope of the project is defined, and a plan of implementing it is established.
- It is in this stage that things like 'goals', 'resources', 'timelines', and 'potential risks'. are identified and documented.

### 2. Analysis

- This stage involves a granular analysis of all the things that were established (requirements) in the Planning stage.
- It is also here that the developers and stakeholders collaborate to gain a thorough understanding of the project objective and constraints.

### 3. Design

- This stage doubles down on the planning of the software architecture (structure and presentation).
- It is here that the system's architecture, database architecture, algorithms, and data models are defined.
- The goal here is to create a blueprint that would guide the developers into fleshing the project to life.

### 4. Implementation (Coding):

- This is where the actual software development happens.
- Here, the developers write the code based on the design specifications and the established code standards.
- Some initial (most times basic) testing occurs in this phase

### 5. Testing:

- After the software has been developed to some point, what follows is some rigorous testing to make sure that the software meets the agreed upon requirements and functionalities.
- Various mode and techniques of testing (e.g: integration testing, system testing, performance testing and user access testig (UAT Test)) are used in this phase to test systems and softwares.

### 6. Deployment:

- When the software has been properly tested and approved, the software is now ready for deployment to the production environment.
- Where necessary, the required data migration should be carried out, the server should be ensured that it is well set up and configs are OK for live operation.

### 7. Maintenance:

- After you have deployed the software to the production environment, maintenance follows.
- This is the stage that handles the issues/bugs that may arise from the use of the software in the production environment. Here, bugs are fixed, updates are applied, and user feedbacks are gotten for future improvements.

__Iterations and Feedback:__

- In the entire SDLC of a product, feedback loops and iterations are ongoing and are crucial - especially between the testing and development phase.
- Promoting the culture of frequent feedback and iterations ensures that the final form of the product fulfils the user needs.

__Methodologies:__

- There are different methodologies that exists on managing the SDLC of a product, these are: 
  - Agile,
  - Waterfall, and
  - DevOps.
These different methodologies influences how these SDLC stages are executed and or organized.

__Benefits of Implementing a proper SDLC Program__
- __Reduced Risk:__ By Planning and stating out (clearly) each stage, the SDLC will assist you in identifying and mitigating early, any potential issues in the development of the product.
- __Improved Quality:__ SDLC lays a clear blueprint for ensuring that a product is fleshed out and properly tested to meet all the agreed-upon requirements and functions.
- __Clear Communication__
The SDLC Plan of a product will catalyze clear communications with direction between colleagues (developers), stakeholders, and end-users across the lifecycle of the products developement.


__Conclusion__

A proplerly planned SDLC of a product provides a very streamlined approach to fleshing out the product from conceptualization to realization while guaranteeing the product high quality and performance if the SDLC is religiously followed.
