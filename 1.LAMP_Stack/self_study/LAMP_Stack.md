# LAMP Stack.
### Introduction

__The combination of different technologies/softwares that enables developers to create feature rich and dynamic web applications is called a stack. LAMP is a stack that is well knowned in the web development niche and is known for its open-source, functional and resourceful nature.__

## Components that Makes up the LAMP Stack
- __Linux:__
This is thee the foundation of the LAMP stack, it is an operating system kernel that helps with the essential infrastructure needed for efficiently running web servers, databases, etc...
Some distros (distributions) of Linux that are popularly used in the lampstack include: Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian.

- __Apache:__ This is the web server software that carries the duty of serving web pages to users. It interpretes and responds to HTTP requests from client browsers. Apache has some cool features like secure connections (SSL/TLS), virtual hosting, and URL re-writing.

- __MySQL:__ MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS), that stores and manages structured data for web applications. It implements a client-server architype, this makes it possible for multiple clients to connect and perform different operations like data retrieval, manipulation, and deletion.

- __PHP__ _(or Python/Perl in some cases)_ __:__ PHP is a server side scripting language that is very vital in creating dynamic web content.
It can be embedded inside a HTML code, in this case, PHP will execute the web server to generate dynamic content before delivering it to the client's browser. PHP is able to interact with databases, can manage files, process forms and do a lot more which are necessary for building feature rich web applications.

### The LAMP workflow

__1.__ __Client Request:__ When a user enters a url in their browser, or clicks a link, it sends the user to the (Apache) web server of that url.

__2.__ __Apache Handles the request:__ The webserver _(Apache in our case)_ handles the HTTP request from the client and begins prcessing it.

__3.__ __PHP Acts:__ If the resource requested is a PHP file, then Apache would redirect the request to the PHP interpreter, this interpreter executes the code in the PHP file.

__4.__ __MySQL Interaction:__ The PHP code that is executed might want to interact with the MySQL database to retrieve or manipulate data.

__5.__ __Apache responds to the request:__ When Apache has finished processing the request, it generates a HTTP response containing the requested resource (webpage). This generated response is now sent to the client's browser.

__6.__ __Client Receives his/her response:__ after the above have been said and done.The client's browser takes in the resoponse from the server for the user to view.


## Advantages of the Stack 

- __It is Open Source:__ Every aspect and elements of the LAMP stack are free to use and modify, this makes it possible for developers to test and customize them as they see fit for different project needs.

- __It is highly scalable:__ It is easy to scale up applications so that they can handle more traffic and users. This scalability can be implemented by adding servers, beefing up your codes, and or implementing caching mechanisms.

- __Community Support:__ This stack being open source also makes it sit on a position of experiencing various professionals come to document/provide valuable helpful articles to help people using this stack.


__Conclusion__

The functionality, reliability and scalability of the LAMP stack has made it endure through various evolution of the internet.
Developerss can harness the functionality of Linux, Apachhe, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) to create high-performance, feature-rich web apps that caters to the demands of contemporary day-to-day users.
