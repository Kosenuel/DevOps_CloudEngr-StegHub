# Study Guide: NAS, SAN, and Modern Storage Systems

## 1. Network Attached Storage (NAS)

### What's NAS All About?

Just think about a digital filing cabinet that everyone in your office can access simultaneously - that's essentially what Network Attached Storage (NAS) is. It's a dedicated file storage machine that provides centralized, shared disk storage to all the devices on your local network through a standard Ethernet connection.

### Why is NAS So Popular?

- __File-level Storage:__ NAS systems handle data as files, just like the documents on your computer.
- __Easy Access:__ Multiple users can reach their files over the network using familiar protocols like NFS, SMB, and FTP.
- __User-Friendly:__ Setting up and managing NAS is often a breeze, requiring minimal IT expertise.
- __Room to Grow:__ Need more storage? Simply add more NAS devices to your network.

## 2. Storage Area Network (SAN)

### SAN: The High-Speed Data Highway

We know that NAS is like a shared filing cabinet, But a Storage Area Network (SAN) is more like a lightning-fast data highway that connects storage devices to servers. Unlike NAS, SAN provides block-level storage, which servers see and use as if it were directly attached to them.

### What Makes SAN Special?

- __Block-level Storage:__ SAN operates at a more granular level, making it a speed machine for data-hungry applications.
- __Performance Powerhouse:__ Built for high-speed data transfer and low latency, SAN exccels in demanding scenarios like bustling databases.
- __Scalability:__ SANs can be beefed up by adding more storage devices or expanding the network infrastructure.
- __Feature-Rich:__ SANs offer advanced capabilities such as storage virtualization, snapshotting, and replication.

## 3. The Protocol Parade

### Network File System (NFS)

- __What is it?__ A protocol that lets you access files over a network as if they were on your local drive.
- __Where it thrives:__ UNIX and Linux environments where file sharing is key.

### Server Message Block (SMB)

- __In a nutshell:__ Is a protocol that enables applications to read, write, and request services from server programs across a network.
- __Where it thrives:__ Windows networks, where it's the go-to for file and printer sharing.

### File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

- __FTP:__ The veteran protocol for moving files between hosts over a TCP-based network.
- __SFTP:__ FTP's security-conscious cousin, that provides file transfer capabilities with added protection.
- __Use case:__ When you need to move files between a client and server across a network.

### Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)

- __What is this tech?__ It is an IP-based standard that bridges data storage facilities, thus allowing SCSI commands to travel over IP networks.
- __What makes this tech cool is:__ Facilitates data transfers over intranets and helps manage storage across long distances.

## 4. Block-level Storage: The Building Blocks of Data

### What's the Block?

Block-level storage manages data in fixed-size chunks called blocks. Each block acts like a separate hard drive, controlled independently by the storage system.

#### Cloud's Take on Blocks

Cloud providers like AWS offer block storage to give virtual machines their own virtual hard drives. Each volume behaves like an independent disk.

#### AWS in Action: Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. This is like each volume is a raw, unformatted virtual disk that is ready for your use.

## 5. Object Storage: The Future of Data Management

### Objects Explained

Object storage takes a different approach, managing data as objects. Each object is a package deal, including the data itself, metadata (information about the data), and a unique ID.

#### AWS's Object Offering: Simple Storage Service (S3)

Amazon S3 is the poster child for object storage that offers scalability, durability, and performance for vast amounts of data.

## 6. Network File Systems: Your Files, Anywhere

### The Networked File Cabinet

Network file systems give you shared access to files over a network. It is just like having a filing cabinet that you can access from any computer in your office.

#### AWS's Take: Elastic File System (EFS)

Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is like a colosal, elastic file system for Linux workloads.

## 7. Comparing Storage Types: What's the Difference?

### Block Storage vs. Object Storage

- __Structure:__ Block storage manages data in fixed-size blocks, while object storage handles data as self-contained objects.
- __Performance:__ Block storage is the speed machine, ideal for applications that needs quick response times. Object storage is the marathon runner that is optimized for scalability and internet-based access.
- __Best For:__ Use block storage for databases, virtual machines, and transaction-heavy applications. Object storage excels with large amounts of unstructured data like backups, archives, and media files.

### Network File System vs. Block and Object Storage

- __Network File System:__ Provides file-level access over a network, perfect for shared file access.
- __Block Storage:__ Offers raw storage volumes for applications that need direct disk access.
- __Object Storage:__ Delivers scalable storage for unstructured data with rich metadata and web-based access.

## In Conclusion

Understanding the nuances between NAS, SAN, and various storage protocols, as well as block-level and object storage, is crucial for choosing the right storage solution for different scenarios. AWS showcases robust examples of each storage type with services like EBS for block storage, S3 for object storage, and EFS for network file systems, each tailored to specific needs in cloud environments. _(I use AWS in our examples because that is the cloud service provider we use for most of the project here. others cloud service providers should also have similara offerings to what we are explaining here)_.
